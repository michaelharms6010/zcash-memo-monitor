# Zcash Memo Monitor

This is a utility designed to automatically detect and add incoming zcash memos to a database. Currently 100% unfinished and in testing, use this code at your own risk :) 

## Acknowledgement

This whole thing relies HEAVILY on the Zecwallet light client CLI by AdityaPK. It's good. See it here: https://github.com/adityapk00/zecwallet-light-cli
